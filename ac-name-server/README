The AnonyChat Name Server Project

The name server is resposible for keeping information about clients 
currently connected to the chat service.

This will allow clients to obtain information about thier peers in the 
network, as well as if thier desired chat partners are currently logged 
in.

It will also provide a way for clients to exchange thier public keys to 
start communication, either via private messaging, or group chat via a 
channel.

The server will also act as a user name server, and will let users 
request specific user names, or assign a random unused name to a client 
if requested.
