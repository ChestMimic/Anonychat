-test load on name server, constant connection
	-load (memory, cpu, network usage) should at least be linear with additional clients
-rrt for messages
	-average message transfer time < 5 times the direct communication between clients.
-check anonymity of messages, ensure source address is obscure
	-if Alice is receiving a message from Bob, the source address of Bob’s messages is changing at least every minute.
-ensure that peers are distributed appropriately
	-every client has a path to every other client
	-frequency of race condition, causing message to be dropped
-verify encryption of messages
	-The messages are indeed encrypted
